# Task Details: High Poly and Low Poly Modeling

## High Poly Model
- **Create a detailed high poly model based on the provided reference image.**
- Ensure that all features, details, and contours from the reference are accurately represented.
- Save and name the file as `HighPoly_Model`.

## Low Poly Model
- **Create a simplified version of the high poly model.**
- Maintain the overall shape and essential features while reducing the poly count for mobile optimization.
- Save and name the file as `LowPoly_Model`.

## Baking Maps
### Normal Map
- Bake the normal map from the high poly model to the low poly model.

### Ambient Occlusion Map
- Bake the ambient occlusion map to add depth and shadow details to the texture.

### Roughness Map
- Create a roughness map to define the reflective properties of different surfaces.

### Export
- Save the baked maps in PNG format with appropriate naming conventions (e.g., `NormalMap.png`, `AOMAP.png`, `RoughnessMap.png`).

## Texturing
- **Use the baked maps to texture the low poly model.**
- Create realistic and game-ready textures, ensuring they are optimized for mobile use.
- Include the following texture maps:
  - Albedo (Base Color) Map
  - Normal Map
  - Roughness Map
  - Ambient Occlusion Map
- Texture resolution should be 1024x1024.

## Submission Requirements
- **High Poly Model File:** `HighPoly_Model.blend`
- **Low Poly Model File:** `LowPoly_Model.blend`
- **Baked Maps:**
  - `NormalMap.png`
  - `AOMAP.png`
  - `RoughnessMap.png`
- **Textures:**
  - `AlbedoMap.png`
  - `NormalMap.png`
  - `RoughnessMap.png`
  - `AOMAP.png`
- **Final Low Poly Model with Textures:** Provide the final low poly model in FBX or OBJ format with embedded or attached textures.
- **Documentation:** A brief document (PDF) explaining your workflow, tools used, and any challenges faced and how they were resolved.

## Deadline
The entire task must be completed and submitted within 2 days from the start of the test.
